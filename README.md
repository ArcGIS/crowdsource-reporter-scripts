## Features

* A script to filter features based on lists of explicit and sensitive words. The script updates a flag field when a word on these lists is detected so that the feature no longer meets the requirements of a filter on a layer in a web map. The script also compares words against a list of good words to avoid accidental filtering.
* A script to generate identifiers for features based on a defined sequence and that increment based on a defined interval.
